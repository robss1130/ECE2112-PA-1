- Firstly, I've learned that while coding the first question, in the while statement, my variable "word", which is a string variable, can be evaluated as a boolean value. 
-  In python, empty strings evaluates to a False, while everything else is True.
-  I've also learned that there is a sort function built in within the python but I was done coding the first question when I found it out.
-  The 2nd question made me realize how powerful dictionary is. Unlike C++, dictionary allows a multitude of application for easy coding.
-  For the last question, I found the append function to be very useful to successfully add values at the end of the list in the middle variable.
